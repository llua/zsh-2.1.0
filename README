zsh is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying permission.

This is zsh 2.1.0, written by Paul Falstad (pfalstad@phoenix.princeton.edu).

To get this shell running, cd into the src directory and type
"buildzsh".  I tested it on the following machines, where it compiled
just by running this script:

Sun SPARCServer 4/490 running SunOS 4.1.1
NeXTstation running Mach 2.0
DECSystem-5000 running ULTRIX 4.2
Sun 3/50M running SunOS 4.0
Iris 4D/20 running IRIX 3.3.1
Tahoe running BSD 4.3 tahoe
HP 9000/855 running HP-UX 8.0
HP 9000/370 running HP-UX 7.05

It should be easier to port the shell to different architectures now.
The reason it hasn't been tested on SysV-like machines is that I don't
have access to any SysV-like machines.  I'd love to have someone port
the shell to other architectures.

Tabstops are 3 spaces.  If you're going to look at my code, run it
though "expand -3" first, or set your tab stops to the same as mine.

If anyone has any questions, suggestions, comments, bugs, flames, or
any other mail of any kind, send it to pfalstad@phoenix.princeton.edu.

Modification history:

0.03-1.0:
	- "..../" is now "****/".  I know this isn't backward compatible,
	  but I had no choice; the string "..../" was unquotable.
	- parser was rewritten and improved
	- completion was improved, several bugs fixed (including
	  the "$([tab]" bug)
	- vi mode editing is improved
	- the value of PWD and OLDPWD in the environment now change
	- the PROMPT formatting strings %W and %D now print the month
	  correctly
	- >&2 echo "error message" no longer prints "bad file number"
	- ${foo%pat} no longer alters the value of foo
	- $_ works
	- ALL_EXPORT no longer causes let statements to crash the shell
	- continue works
	- echo $MAIL no longer dumps core if MAIL is null
	- the new tty driver is selected by default
	- the s modifier no longer complains if it can't find the string
	  to substitute
	- list-choices no longer fignores files
	- cd is now smarter about symlinks
	- negative subscripts other than -1 now work
	- $(<filename) works better if filename contains $, ~, or =
	- rehash no longer wastes memory
	- with name=value assignments, name is checked to see if it is
	  a valid identifier
	- !1; !2 no longer eats the semicolon
	- $foo:h never returns the empty string if foo starts with /
	- select crashed with some compilers
	- problems with aliases in <(...) constructs have been fixed
	- links pointing to nowhere are denoted with an '&' in listtypes
	- negative arguments are supported
	- the shell does not screw around with the tty so much
	- lots of other stuff

0.02-0.03:
	- two stupid bugs that were introduced in the last patch were fixed:
	  - multiple command substitution on a line failed
	  - a file descriptor leak caused the shell to crash after a while
	- added 'An Introduction to the Z Shell'
	- behaves properly when the tty session dies suddenly
	- had a serious memory leak on some systems
	- the test and [ builtins have been added, although [[...]]
	  is more efficient
	- in your prompt, %m2 now prints foo.bar, %m3 prints foo.bar.com, etc.
	- the -D and -P options to print have been added
	- the NULLCMD and ZDOTDIR parameters have been added
	- ${*:-foo} works
	- "$@" and "$arr[@]" work like ksh
	- .zprofile is sourced before .zshrc in login shells
	- the CSHJUNKIEQUOTES and PUSHDMINUS options have been added
	- REAL_TTY compilation switch added
	- aliases beginning with a space cause the history line to be junked
	  if HISTIGNORESPACE is set
	- echo prints bad options instead of complaining about them
	- "set -o" no longer dumps core
	- "alias a=alias; date >a" no longer creates a file called "alias"
	- "function foo() \n { date }" is now legal (the () and the newline
	  are allowed)
	- nested brace expressions work properly
	- disabled commands stay disabled after a rehash (or after the shell
	  finishes sourcing your .zshrc)
	- corrected aliases work
	- executables in the currect directory are now completed
	- in "case foo", "foo" is not interpreted as a directory name with autocd
	- aliases were not always interpreted properly after a completion
	- bindkey '^?' didn't work
	- echo ${HOST:-{bar}} didn't work
	- editor update is more efficient in some cases
	- menucomplete works even better
	- assign to an array element "foo[1]=bar" didn't always work
	- doesn't print directories like "~tmp" if HOME=/
	- quotes in case statement patterns caused problems
	- pressing ^C right after typing "fc" caused the editor to share
	  the tty with the shell
	- echo $(echo 2) produced no output, but echo $(echo x) worked fine (weird)

0.01-0.02:
	- added script to convert most csh aliases to zsh aliases or functions
	- fc -l (history) now appears in the history itself; HISTNOSTORE
	  option added to get old behavior

	  to use them

	- if the right side of a variable assignment expands to more than
	  one word, array assignment is assumed; so foo=*.c now works
	- ~foo is no longer expanded in completion
	- select now works even if the argument list is not sorted
	- menucompletebeep option added
	- emacs mode is now 8-bit clean by default; use bindkey -em
	  to get your meta key back
	- fc -R, fc -W added
	- nocorrect added
	- lines from history file are now split into words at spaces
	- glob-complete, accept-and-menu-complete,
	  beginning-of-line-hist, end-of-line-hist bindings added
