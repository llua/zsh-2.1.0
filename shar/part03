X.SH PARAMETERS
XA parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.
XA name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
Xcharacters and _'s, or the single characters
X*, @, #, ?, \-, $, or !.
XThe value may be either a \fIscalar\fP (a string),
Xan integer, or an array.
XTo assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter,
Xuse the \fBtypeset\fP builtin.
XTo assign an array value, use \fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP \fIvalue\fP ....
XThe value of a parameter may also be assigned by writing:
X.RS
X.PP
X\fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP ...
X.RE
X.PP
XIf the integer attribute, \-\fBi\fP, is set for \fIname\fP,
Xthe \fIvalue\fP is subject to arithmetic evaluation.
X.PP
XThe value of an array parameter may be assigned by writing:
X.RS
X.PP
X\fIname\fP=(\fIvalue\fP ...) ...
X.RE
XIndividual elements of an array may be selected using a 
Xsubscript.  A subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp\fB]\fR
Xselects the single element \fIexp\fP, where \fIexp\fP is
Xan arithmetic expression.  The elements are numbered
Xbeginning with 1.
XA subscript of the form \fB[*]\fP or \fB[@]\fP evaluates to all
Xelements of an array; there is no difference between the two
Xexcept when they appear within double quotes.
X"$foo[*]" evaluates to "$foo[1] $foo[2] ...", while
X"$foo[@]" evaluates to "$foo[1]" "$foo[2]", etc.
XA subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp1\fP,\fIexp2\fB]\fR
Xselects all elements in the range \fIexp1\fP to \fIexp2\fP,
Xinclusive.
XIf one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number,
Xsay \-\fIn\fP, then the \fIn\fPth element from the end
Xof the array is used.  Thus "$foo[-3]" is the third element
Xfrom the end of the array \fIfoo\fP, and
X"$foo[1,-1]" is the same as "$foo[*]".
X.PP
XSubscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which
Xcase the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted.
XFor example, if \fBFOO\fP is set to \fBfoobar\fP, then
X\fBecho $FOO[2,5]\fP prints \fBooba\fP.
X.SS Positional Parameters
XPositional parameters are set by the shell on invocation,
Xby the \fBset\fP builtin, or by direct assignment.
XThe parameter \fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a number,
Xis the \fIn\fPth positional parameter.
XThe parameters \fB*\fP, \fB@\fP, and \fBargv\fP are
Xarrays containing all the positional parameters;
Xthus \fBargv\fP[\fIn\fP], etc. is equivalent to simply \fIn\fP.

XThe baud rate of the current connection.  Used by the line editor
Xupdate mechanism to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying

Xin some circumstances, e.g.
Xfor slow modems dialing into a communications server which is connected
Xto a host via a fast link; in this case, this variable
Xwould be set by default to the speed of the fast link, and not
Xthe modem.
XThis parameter should be set to the baud
Xrate of the slowest part of the link for best performance.

XThree characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis
Xmechanism.  The first character signals the start of a history

X.PP
X.PD 0
X.TP
X\fIn\fPh
Xhours.
X.TP
X\fIn\fPk
Xkilobytes.

X\fBpopd\fP [ \(+-\fIn\fP ]
XRemoves entries from the directory stack.  With no arguments,
Xremoves the top directory from the stack, and performs a \fBcd\fP
Xto the new top directory.  With an argument of the form +\fIn\fP,
Xremove the \fIn\fPth entry counting from the left of the list
Xshown by the \fBdirs\fP command, starting with zero, and change
Xto that directory.  With an argument of the form \-\fIn\fP,
Xremove the \fIn\fPth entry counting from the right.
XIf the \fBPUSHD_MINUS\fP option is set, the meanings of +
Xand \- in this context are swapped.
X.TP
X\fBprint\fP [ \-\fBRnrslz0DP\fP ] [ \fIarg\fP ... ]
XWith no flags or with flag \-, the arguments are printed on
Xthe standard output as described by \fBecho\fP.
X.RS
X.PD 0
X.TP
X\-\fBR\fP, \-\fBr\fP
Xignore the escape conventions of \fBecho\fP.
XThe \-\fBR\fP option will print all subsequent
Xarguments and options.

Xexpressions, as appropriate.

X\fBpushd\fP [ \fIarg\fP ]
X.TP
X\fBpushd\fP \fIold\fP \fInew\fP
X.TP
X\fBpushd\fP \(+-\fBn\fP
X.PD
XChange the current directory, and push the old current directory
Xonto the directory stack.  In the first form, change the
Xcurrent directory to \fIarg\fP.
XIf \fIarg\fP is not specified, change to the second directory
Xon the stack (that is, exchange the top two entries), or
Xchange to the value of \fBHOME\fP if the \fBPUSHD_TO_HOME\fP
Xoption is set or if there is only one entry on the stack.
XIf \fIarg\fP is \-, change to the
Xvalue of \fBOLDPWD\fP, the previous directory.
XIf a directory named \fIarg\fP is not found in the current directory
Xand \fIarg\fP does not contain a slash,
Xsearch each component of the shell parameter \fBcdpath\fP.
XIf the option \fBCDABLEVARS\fP is set, and a parameter named \fIarg\fP
Xexists whose value begins with a slash, treat its value as
Xthe directory.
XIf the option \fBPUSHD_SILENT\fP is not set, the directory
Xstack will be printed after a \fBpushd\fP is performed.
X.RS
X.PP
XThe second form of \fBpushd\fP substitutes the string \fInew\fP
Xfor the string \fIold\fP in the name of the current directory,
Xand tries to change to this new directory.
X.PP
XThe third form of \fBpushd\fP is equivalent to \fBpopd\fP.
X.RE
X.TP
X\fBpwd\fP
XEquivalent to \fBprint \-R $PWD\fP.
X.TP

XEquivalent to \fBfc \-e \-\fP.
X.TP
X\fBread\fP [ \-\fBrz\fP ] [ \fIname\fP?\fIprompt\fP ] [ \fIname\fP ...  ]
XRead one line and break it into fields using the characters
Xin \fBIFS\fP as separators.  In raw mode, \-\fBr\fP, a \e
Xat the end of a line does not signify line continuation.
XIf the \-\fBz\fP flag is set, read from the editor buffer stack.
XThe first field is assigned to the first \fIname\fP, the second field
Xto the second \fIname\fP, etc., with leftover
Xfields assigned to the last \fIname\fP.
XIf \fIname\fP is omitted then \fBREPLY\fP is used.
XThe exit status is 0 unless end-of-file is encountered.
XIf the first argument contains a \fB?\fP, the remainder of this
Xword is used as a \fIprompt\fP on standard error when the shell
Xis interactive.  The exit status is 0 unless an end-of-file
Xis encountered.
X.TP
X\fBreadonly\fP [ \fIname\fP[=\fIvalue\fP] ] ...
XThe given \fInames\fP are marked readonly; these names
Xcannot be changed by subsequent assignment.

XRescan the command path, rebuilding the hash table of commands.
X.TP
X\fBreturn\fP [ \fIn\fP ]
XCauses a shell function or \fB\&.\fP script to return to
Xthe invoking script
Xwith the return status specified by \fIn\fP.  If \fIn\fP
Xis omitted then the return status is that of the last command
Xexecuted.

X.TP
X\fBsched\fP [ \-\fIitem\fP ]

XSet the options for the shell and/or set the positional parameters, or
Xdeclare an array.  For the meaning of the flags, see
X\fBOPTIONS\fP above.
XFlags may be specified by name using the \-\fBo\fP option.
XIf the \-\fBA\fP flag is specified, \fIname\fP is set to an
Xarray containing the given \fIarg\fPs.
XOtherwise the positional parameters are set.
XIf no arguments are given, then the names and values
Xof all parameters are printed on the standard output.
XIf the only argument is +, the names of all parameters are printed.
X.TP
X\fBsetopt\fP [ \(+-\fIoptions\fP ] [ \fIname\fP ... ]
XSet the options for the shell.  All options specified either
Xwith flags or by name are set.  If no arguments are supplied,
Xthe names of all options currently set are printed.
XIn option names, case is insignificant, and all underscore
Xcharacters are ignored.
X.TP
X\fBshift\fP [ \fIn\fP ]
XThe positional parameters from $\fIn\fP+\fB1\fP ... are renamed
X$\fB1\fP, where \fIn\fP is an arithmetic expression that
Xdefaults to 1.
X.TP
X\fBsource\fP
XSame as \fB.\fP.
X.TP
X\fBsuspend\fP [ \-\fBf\fP ]
XSuspend the execution of the shell (send it a \fBSIGTSTP\fP)
Xuntil it receives a \fBSIGCONT\fP.
XIf the \-\fBf\fP option is not given, complain if this is a login shell.
X.TP
X.PD 0
X\fBtest\fP \fIarg\fP ...
X.TP
X\fB[\fP \fIarg\fP ... \fB]\fP
X.PD
XLike the system version of \fBtest\fP.  Added for compatibility;
Xuse conditional expressions instead.
X.TP
X\fBtimes\fP
XPrint the accumulated user and system times for the shell
Xand for processes run from the shell.
X.TP
X\fBtrap\fP [ \fIarg\fP ] [ \fIsig\fP ] ...
X\fIarg\fP is a command to be read and executed when the shell
Xreceives \fIsig\fP.  Each \fIsig\fP can be given as a number
Xor as the name of a signal.
XIf \fIarg\fP is \-, then all traps \fIsig\fP are reset to their
Xdefault values.  If \fIarg\fP is the null string, then this signal
Xis ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
XIf \fIsig\fP is \fBERR\fP then \fIarg\fP will be executed
